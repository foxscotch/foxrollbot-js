# foxrollbot (JS)

This is a dice-rolling bot for Telegram, re-written in JavaScript. To use it,
[send it a message](https://telegram.me/foxrollbot). It'll tell you everything
you need to know.

It's MIT-licensed, and I'm developing it with Node 9.0.0, but it'll probably
work with most recent versions. For the most part, I am trying to follow the
[AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#strings--line-length)
for JavaScript. It doesn't say anything about JSDoc, but as a general rule:
break at 100 for the longer descriptions of classes and functions, but do not
break for individual tag descriptions like @param.

And for the record, the version currently running the bot is still the
[older Python version](https://github.com/foxscotch/foxrollbot).
